Classification is a form of `supervised learning` that bears a lot in common with regression techniques. If machine learning is all about predicting values or names to things by using datasets, then classification generally falls into two groups: binary classification and multiclass classification.

Remember:

- Linear regression helped you predict relationships between variables and make accurate predictions on where a new datapoint would fall in relationship to that line. So, you could predict what price a pumpkin would be in September vs. December, for example.
- Logistic regression helped you discover "binary categories": at this price point, is this pumpkin orange or not-orange?
- Classification uses various algorithms to determine other ways of determining a data point's label or class. Let's work with this cuisine data to see whether, by observing a group of ingredients, we can determine its cuisine of origin.
